hello ${sender_name},

Christmas is coming up. That time of year when friends get together and have a good ass time.

There's this group of housemates on my good list. Four Software engineers, one Ecologist, and a university student studying social work. As you well know, it's my responsibility to deliver them presents.

But Santa is getting old. I've seen more sunsets then I'm gonna see. My bones creak when I walk and I no longer command the respect of Rudolph. This is where you come in.

I need YOU to buy a present for ${sendee_name}. Make it exactly 20 bucks give or take. Not a penny more, not a penny less.

cheers dude,
Santa

P.S.
Keep this shit a secret. I don't want the word getting out that I'm hiring third party help.
